        <span>Hello! I'm Caesar üëãüèΩ </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        As a recent graduate with a BS in Computer Science and Information
        Security, I blend software development expertise with a strong
        foundation in cybersecurity principles. I thrive on creating intuitive,
        secure applications that make a real difference in users' lives.
      </p>
      <h1>What Drives Me</h1>
      <p>
        My fascination with technology goes beyond just writing code. I'm
        constantly exploring new ways to solve real-world problems through
        innovative solutions. Take my home server project, for example: Using a
        Raspberry Pi, I built a seamless note-synchronization system that kept
        my academic materials in sync across all my devices. This project not
        only solved a practical need but also deepened my command-line expertise
        and introduced me to the power of Emacs for efficient note-taking.

        My interest and curiousity in technology has led me to explore various
        avenues in the tech industry. One of a recent ongoing projects is a
        homeserver that involves a RaspberryPi. I used this RaspberryPi setup to
        sync college lecture and notes between my laptop and desktop. I found
        this very useful becuase all my notes would be available on all my
        devices with ease. In the process I became well aquinted using the
        terminal and Emacs (for notetaking).
